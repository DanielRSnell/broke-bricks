- **Timber/Twig Integration**: Access Timber and Twig within the Bricks editor or from the theme level for unprecedented control and flexibility. 🌲
- **Cwicly Migration Mode**: A new admin setting option that brings in Cwicly's CSS/JS, enhancing the experience when using Tailwind Mode. Recommended for seamlessly transferring components from Cwicly to Bricks. 🔄

### Cwicly Migration Mode

Utilize "Cwicly Migration Mode" in conjunction with the Bricksbender plugin to easily migrate your components from Cwicly into Bricks. Follow these steps for a smooth transition:

1. On your Cwicly site, disable all performance plugins.
2. Navigate to the page you wish to convert, and open it on the frontend.
3. Use the inspector to copy the section/component from the DOM.
4. Use Bricksbender to paste it into Bricks.

#### Caveats

- Dynamic components will need to be set to dynamic.
- Post-specific styling, such as on dynamic items, will not be applied. Consider adding a Tailwind grid/flex layout to the element.
- Remove any additional dynamic items, ensuring only 1 item is repeating in the query.
- Any other post-specific styling required will either need to be switched to Tailwind, or you can copy over the styling into the child theme and enqueue it.
